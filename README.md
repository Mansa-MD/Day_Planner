# Work Day Scheduler

*Created an application using html, css, bootstrap and javascript code to generate a work day scheduler with a time limit of 60 seconds for user to answer a series of random questions, when the timer countdown reaches zero the quiz will end. This app will run in the browser and feature a clean, polished, responsive user interface. Ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.

You'll need to use the [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) library to work with date and time. Be sure to read the documentation carefully and concentrate on using Moment.js in the browser.
